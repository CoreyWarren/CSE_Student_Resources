Astar search code in Python 3

### VIDEO GUIDE used:
### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob4faIum4kQ

### What is this?

This is an application of the A-Star Search Algorithm. A-Star search is an intelligent path-finding algorithm in which the algorithm is always checking the current distance from the current node to the target node. It is this characteristic that makes Astar search more intelligent than other well-known algorithms, such as Dijkstra's.

### How much of this code is original?

All the comments are made by me. They make it so one can simply read the code rather than have to follow along in the video.
