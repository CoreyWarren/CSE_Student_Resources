# CSE_Student_Resources
Resources that I have created, as well as the sources used for them. This is stuff I wish I had as a CS Freshman/Sophomore.

### Planned Resources I need to make:

-> Various Sorting Algorithm Methods in Python + Independent Research Paper

--> Quick Sort, std::sort, Heap Sort, Insertion Sort


-> The Security of Cryptocurrencies + Independent Research Paper


-> Game Theory + Independent Research Paper
