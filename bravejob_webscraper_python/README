Aside from the python libraries mentioned directly in the code, you will also need a chromedriver in your PATH to run this code.
Here you can download chromedrivers:
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
How do I add Python/chromedrivers to PATH so that python can find it?:
\/
setx /m path "%path%;c:\WebDriver\bin\"
/\
Use the above command, and don't forget to:
1) Create that actual filepath yourself if it does not exist already.
2) Place the appropriate chromedriver in this exact location (inside \bin, yes)
3) Make sure your chrome/brave browser is up to date
4) Make sure you downloaded the appropriate version of chromedriver
